# Ai_Search

Welcome to the README file!

This code implements a Breadth First Search and will eventually also include Iterative Deepening and A* search. 

HOW TO USE THE SEARCH

The terminal command used to run this program is as follows:

python "filename" "test case" "type of search"

When inputting what files we actually want to use, we don't include the " symbols. For example, if we wanted to test the file labeled "test_case_2.txt" with our breadth first search we would do this:

python Breath_First_Search.py test_case_2.txt bfs

As you can see, there are no " symbols when we type our files and the search we want. When running this program with the test cases, make sure all files are in the same directory/folder as to not cause any problems with file locations. When inputting the type of search, they will be acronyms. Obviously right now the only search we have implemented is breadth first search labeled as "bfs". Upper or lower case doesn't matter. 

There is also a small typo in the file name currently. The file name right is now is "Breath_First_Search.py" instead of "Breadth_First_Search.py"

This will eventually be changed to a more general name as we will have multiple searches. 

If you have any typos or miss any parameters when inputting the terminal command, the program and compiler will let you know. Otherwise refer to the instructions above if any issues occur.
